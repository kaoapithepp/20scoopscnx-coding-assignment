# 20ScoopsCNX Coding Assignment
A repository for collecting 20ScoopsCNX coding assignment.

## Problems
They are 5 problems which have to be solved by using algorithm theories.
Problem02: Find highest from given numeric array
Problem03: Sorting from given numeric array.
Problem04: Find highest from given array of object dataset 1.
Problem05: Sorting highest from given array of object dataset 1.
Problem06: Find highest by attribute from given array of object dataset 2.

## Approach
I read entire of requirement and analyze before start to solve these problems. So, I decided to solve Problem05 and Problem 06 first and then applied with any other problems later to write only once and fit all.
